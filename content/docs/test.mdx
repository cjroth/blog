Fumadocs is a powerful documentation framework built on top of Next.js, but it's also perfect for building modern blogs. Here's how I built this blog.

## Why Fumadocs?

Fumadocs provides everything you need for content-focused sites:

- MDX support with custom components
- Built-in syntax highlighting
- Dark mode support
- Type-safe content with Zod schemas
- Excellent performance out of the box

## Code Example

Here's a simple example of how clean the code can be:

```js
console.log('Hello World');
```

## Rich Components

Fumadocs comes with beautiful components out of the box:

<Cards>
  <Card title="Learn more about Next.js" href="https://nextjs.org/docs" />
  <Card title="Learn more about Fumadocs" href="https://fumadocs.dev" />
</Cards>

These components make your content more engaging and easier to navigate.
