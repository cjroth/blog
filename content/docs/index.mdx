Welcome to my blog! This is where I share my thoughts on software engineering, design, and building products that matter.

## Why Start a Blog?

Writing helps me crystallize my thoughts and share what I've learned with others. Whether it's a technical deep-dive, design philosophy, or lessons from building products, this is my space to explore ideas and connect with like-minded people.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Software engineering best practices and architecture
- Product design and user experience
- Building and scaling startups
- Tools and workflows that make me more productive
- Lessons learned from shipping products
